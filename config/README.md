# Configuration Files

## Setup

1. Copy `config.example.yaml` to `config.yaml`
2. Fill in your API credentials
3. **Never commit `config.yaml`** - it's in .gitignore

## Security Notes

- Keep your private key files (`kalshidemo.txt`, `zachdaube.txt`) in the project root
- These files are excluded by `.gitignore`
- Never share your API keys or private keys
- Use demo environment for all testing
